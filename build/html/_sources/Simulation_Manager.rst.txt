SimulationManager
==============

The SimulationManager is the top-level class in JAX-FLUIDS. It provides functionality to perform conventional CFD simulations as well as end-to-end optimization of ML models.
The most important methods of the SimulationManager are:
1. simulate()               -   Performs conventional CFD simulation.
                                Output
2. feedforward()            -   Feedforward of a batch of data, i.e., advances a batch of initial conditions in time for a fixed amount of steps
3. do_integration_step()    -   Performs a single integration step
